# PONG-REMAKE
A classic Pong-style game built in Unity using C#, focused on clean gameplay logic, responsive controls, and simple game systems.

This is a fully playable Pong-style game developed in Unity using C#.

The project was created to practice gameplay programming fundamentals, including player input, physics-based movement, scoring systems, and game state management.

The focus of this project is clean, readable code and responsive gameplay rather than visuals.

Key features implemented:

• Player paddle movement with input handling

• Ball movement and collision logic

• Scoring system

• Game states (start, play, reset)

• UI for score display



Paddel 1:

- W / S → Move paddle up and down

Paddel 2 :

-UpArrow  = UP 

-DownArrow = DOWN



 Download the build and run the executable to play.



This project is part of my portfolio as a self-taught junior Unity developer.
